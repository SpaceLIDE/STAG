# Space Tumbling Attitude Data Generation (STAG) Experiment - CODE REPOSITORY

Description
-----------

The STAG experiment aims to provide dataÂ on the motion and attitude of tumbling objects in microgravity. The data (acceleration, rotation rate, pressure, temperature, and monocular imagery) is collected during parabolic flight performed with gliders. The dataset can be used for validation of attitude estimation techniques based on monocular imagery, and for dynamics analysis and simulation of non-cooperative objects. The dataset will continue to grow as more flights become available, testing different object shapes and inertias.

Data
----

The data cen be retrieved from the Zenodo repository: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8410646.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8410646)

Code
----

A simple python script that was used to produce the plots of the paper is available in the `data_processing` subfolder.
